    <p>
      Rain is a form a precipitation that falls to the ground when clouds become filled with water droplets. Rain is important because it's a source for fresh water that feeds to streams, lakes, rivers, etc. It helps with agriculture, industry, and heigene. It forms when water evaporates into the air as water vapor. As the water vapor cools, it turns back into water, forming around dust or other particles in the air. If there is a large amount of these droplets, then it'll form a cloud. Eventually, the droplets will become to heavy and fall back to the ground, going into various bodies of water eventually. From there, it evaporates again, therefore trapping the water in an endless cycle called the water cycle.
