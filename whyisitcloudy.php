      <p>      Similar to rain, clouds form when water vapor condense on particles. Defined by weather.gov as "a visible aggregate of minute droplets of water or particles of ice or a mixture of both floating in the free air", clouds are a common feature of the weather around the Laguna Niguel area. Clouds are usually made of water droplets, as small as a hundredth of a millimeter, and one cubic meter can contain over 100 million droplets. At higher elevations, clouds can be composed of ice crystals.
