      <p>Snow is a form of precipitation that forms when water vapor starts to freeze. It falls as ice crystals from clouds when temperatures are below freezing and the humudity meets specific requirments. When these requirments are met, water vapor condenses into ice without going through the liquid stage. It continues to absorb more water vapor from the air surrounding it, commonly growing into a snow crystal or pellet, which will eventually fall back down to Earth. Snow is important to Earth because sunlight is reflected back to space when it hits the snow, making the Earth much cooler. It is also used for drinking water and affects migration and hibernation.
